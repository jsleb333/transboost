    Context manager to manage an iterator by using callbacks at 4 different moments in the iteration: 'on_iteration_begin', 'on_iteration_end', 'on_step_begin', 'on_step_end'. Additionally, it will call 'on_exception_exit' callbacks if an exception should occur during the iteration.

    The iteration is managed with BreakCallbacks which should raise a StopIteration exception 'on_step_begin' or 'on_step_end' when a condition is not satisfied.

    The manager should be called in a 'with' statement so that the callbacks are called. The __exit__ method also handles 'on_exception_exit' callbacks if the iteration was terminated by an exception, and will always call 'on_iteration_end'.

    On each iteration step, a Step object is returned.

            step (Object with __next__ method defined, optional): Each __next__ call of CallbacksManagerIterator will return the object returned by next(step). If None, a Step object counting the number of iterations will be returned.
