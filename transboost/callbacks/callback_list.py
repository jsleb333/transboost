    """
    Class that aggregates all Callback objects. The class aims to mimick the behaviour of a single callback.

    CallbackList will call all appropriate callbacks at the right time. BreakCallbacks are treated separately from ordinary callbacks. This is to ensure all callbacks are called before a StopIteration exception is called (this would prevent ordinary callbacks to be called).

    To facilitate the use of callbacks within a manager, when a manager is set to self.manager, all present callbacks' manager are also set to this manager. Moreover, all subsequently appended callbacks will be assigned this manager.

            callbacks (Iterable of Callback objects, optional): All callbacks methods will be called on time with this CallbackList. Callbacks can always be appended later and their manager will be set to the same as the CallbackList manager.
